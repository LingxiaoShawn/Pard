## About


## Installation

## Usage


## Diffusion

We use the most basic discrete-time diffusion in [USD3](https://github.com/LingxiaoShawn/USD3). The USD3 contains more sophisticated discrete diffusion, with improvement in both discrete-time and continuous-time case. We suggest people who want to use discrete diffusion to check out the code and the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03701.pdf).
